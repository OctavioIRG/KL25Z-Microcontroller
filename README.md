# KL25Z-Microcontroller
Implementation of several proyects on the FRDM-KL25Z development board
This repository contains the projects that I've developed as part of my microcontrollers class in Tec de Monterrey. 
Hopefully this could serve as an example to other students as well as reference for my self. 
The majority of the codes are written in C and some in ASM.
